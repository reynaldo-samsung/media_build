V4L/DVB building procedures are based on the use of Makefile rules.
These rules are similar to the ones used by the Linux Kernel to
allow for an easier and more intuitive process.

=======================================================================
Quick building procedure is:
    make all
=======================================================================

For those who may want something different than just building everything,
there are some other interesting parameters you can pass to make:

Normal building rules:
=====================

all               - Build all modules

clean             - Clean compiled files from the tree, but
                    keep the latest used configuration and
                    kernel version

distclean         - Clean compiled files from the tree alongside
                    latest used configuration and kernel version.

default           - Continue building the latest module selection.
                    This is the behavior when just type: make

install           - Install all modules at kernel's default install
                    dir for V4L/DVB. Requires root access.

rminstall         - Clean previously installed V4L/DVB modules

sound-install     - Install the sound related V4L/DVB modules to
                    the default install dir.

Firmware rules:
==============

firmware          - Create the firmware files that are included with
                    the tree.
                    Notice: Only very few firmware files are currently
                    being distributed.

firmware_install  - Install firmware files under /lib/firmware

Module selection rules:
======================

Notice: These may require write access to the kernel tree.

allmodconfig      - Called by make all. Selects all modules that are
                    known to compile against the kernel version used.

stagingconfig     - Select all modules, plus all staging modules. The
                    staging drivers are there because they may have
                    bad userspace API's, serious bugs and/or not comply
                    with kernel required quality standards. Be careful
                    with them.

xconfig           - Generate a xconfig menu. Requires full
                    kernel source, since it depends on kernel's
                    qconf script.

gconfig           - Generate a qt menu. Requires full kernel source,
                    since it depends on the kernel's gconf script.

config            - Generate a text-mode menu. Requires full kernel
                    source cause it depends on the kernel's conf
                    script.

menuconfig        - Generate an ncurses menu. Requires full kernel source,
                    cause it depends on the kernel's mconf and lxconfig
                    scripts.

release           - Allows selecting a particular kernel version for the
                    build.

                    Typical usage is:

                    make release VER=2.6.12-18mdk
                    (to force compiling to 2.6.12-18mdk)
                    (This will work only if
                    /lib/modules/2.6.12-18mdk/build/
                    points to that kernel version)

                    Or

                    make release DIR=~/linux-git
                    (to force using kernel at a specific dir)
                    To use current kernel version instead:
                    make release

Module handling rules:
=====================

(require root access)

insmod            - Insert all modules from V4L/DVB tree

rmmod             - Remove all modules from V4L/DVB tree

reload            - Remove then reinsert all modules

Tree merging rules:
==================

ivtv              - Enable merged ivtv build, using the latest ivtv
                    sources from ivtvdriver.org (requires subversion)

cx88-ivtv         - Enable cx88-blackbird ivtv API emulation

ivtv-update       - Update ivtv sources from ivtvdriver.org

Patch preparation and tree handling rules:
=========================================

(used by developers)

kernel-links      - Generate links to V4L/DVB at kernel tree.
                    Requires write access to kernel tree.

cardlist          - Updates Documentation/video4linux/CARDLIST.*

update            - Updates the tree from master repository

commit            - Commits the change, asking for a commit msg

push              - Sends outgoing work to master repository

checkemacs        - Checks coding style and reports to emacs
                    using "make checkemacs" at emacs compile menu,
                    will report the lines with errors inside emacs.

checkpatch        - Checks coding style and reports using the same
                    format as c. This way, c error parsers will
                    handle it.

checkterse        - Checks coding style and reports using terse
                    syntax, used on several compilation tools.

mismatch          - Checks for linker section mismatch. In other words,
                    checks if some driver has functions not properly
                    declared with __init/__exit, and similar tags.
                    It will also be more pedantic by dealing with
                    compilation warnings as if they were errors.
